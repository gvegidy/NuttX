   * This class describes the NX window manager's task bar.  That task bar is,
   * of course, used to dock active applications.  But in NxWM, it is also
   * the heart of the window manager:  It inherits for CNxServer and, hence,
   * represents the NX server itself.  It also then serves as the NxWM
   * window factory.
   *
   * Why do it this way?  The only reason is so that if you have an instance
   * of CTaskbar, you have everything you need to manage new applications.
   * It might have been a better decision to separate the window factory into
   * a separate class instead of making the task bar of such central importance
   * (and I may still do that someday)
