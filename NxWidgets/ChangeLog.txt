* The initial release of the NxWidgets package

1.1 2012-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

* Updated and verified the NxWidgets DOxygen documentation.  Contributed
  by Jose Pablo Carballo.
* IBitmap, CRlePalettBitmap:  Extended class to support differnt LUTs
  for selected and non-selected images.
* CImage: If selected, uses different LUTs based, different borders.
  CImage is now basically a button type.
* CImage: Add logic to hightlight an CImage (using the selected LUT).
* nxwm: The tiny NX window manager (NxWM) is being developed in this directory.
* UnitTests/nxwm:  A unit test for the NX window manager.
* CWidgetControl:  Add a semaphore to force clients to wait if the
  size or position of the window is not yet known (multi-user mode only).
* During integration of NxWM, corrected numerous problems with NxWidgets
  running on toolbars and framed windows.  That capability was commented
  out in the 1.0 release but is verfied functional in 1.1.
* CRlePalettBitmap: Fix an error in the text that determines if we
  need to "rewind" to the beginning of the image.
* CRlePalettBitmap: Fixe a positioning problem.  It was actually losing
  the last row of every image!
* CNxWidget: Removed support for "shelving" widgets.  I will be removing
  some lesser used feature over time in order to reduce the NxWidgets
  footprint.
* CNxWidget: Removed support for reference constants and close types.
  The goal is to ge the base widget class as small as possible.
* CNxTkWindow:  Fix uninitialized pointer value.
