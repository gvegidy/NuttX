1.0 2012-03-22 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

* The initial release of the NxWidgets package

1.1 2012-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

* Updated and verified the NxWidgets DOxygen documentation.  Contributed
  by Jose Pablo Carballo.
* IBitmap, CRlePalettBitmap:  Extended class to support differnt LUTs
  for selected and non-selected images.
* CImage: If selected, uses different LUTs based, different borders.
  CImage is now basically a button type.
* CImage: Add logic to hightlight an CImage (using the selected LUT).
* nxwm: The tiny NX window manager (NxWM) is being developed in this directory.
* UnitTests/nxwm:  A unit test for the NX window manager.
* CWidgetControl:  Add a semaphore to force clients to wait if the
  size or position of the window is not yet known (multi-user mode only).
* During integration of NxWM, corrected numerous problems with NxWidgets
  running on toolbars and framed windows.  That capability was commented
  out in the 1.0 release but is verfied functional in 1.1.
* CRlePalettBitmap: Fix an error in the text that determines if we
  need to "rewind" to the beginning of the image.
* CRlePalettBitmap: Fixe a positioning problem.  It was actually losing
  the last row of every image!
* CNxWidget: Removed support for "shelving" widgets.  I will be removing
  some lesser used feature over time in order to reduce the NxWidgets
  footprint.
* CNxWidget: Removed support for reference constants and close types.
  The goal is to ge the base widget class as small as possible.
* CNxTkWindow:  Fix uninitialized pointer value.
* CNxToolbar:  Need to "fake" the fix position callback to avoid
  deadlock waits for the callback that won't happen.
* CNxTkWindow:  Fix toolbar background color
* CWidgetControl:  Don't declare the the geometry is good until a non-NULL
  window size is received.
* CGraphicsPort and CWidgetControl:  If the underlying graphics device
  is write-only, then we have to render fonts a little differently.
* CNxWidgets, CWidgetControl, and CRectCache:  Big change!  Remove all support
  for widgets in a "vertical" hierarchy.  Now widgets exist in a flat,
  two-dimensional space and should not overlap.  This should greatly
  reduce the memory requirements and, since, NuttX already supports
  a hierarchical windowing system, does not result in loss of functionality.
* CNxWidgets and CWidgetControl.  Remove specific built-in support for
  modal loops.  There are too many different control mechanisms that might
  be needed.  Replace with hooks to control widget events from totally
  external logic.
* CWindowEventHandler, CWindowEventHandlerList, CWidgetControl: New
  callback classes to receive notifications about window events.
* NxWM::CFullScreenWindow and NxWM::CTaskbar:  Add support in NxWM for full
  screen window applications.
* All application windows now use CWindowEventHandler and CWindowEventHandlerList
  to get notifications about mouse and keyboard events.  These class will
  then automatically handle polling (with no need for a modal loop).
* NxWM::CTouchscreen and NxWM::CCalibration: Add touchscreen support (still a long
  way to go).
* NxWM::g_playBitmp: Change the play icon again.  These tiny touch icons
  must be very simple.
* NxWM::CCalibration: Beef up touch input handling logic.  Now changes the
  color of the touch circle to yellow when it is touched.
* NxWM::CTouchscreen: Do not read touchscreen data when there is no consumer.
* NxWM::CWindowControl:  Add new class to wrap CWidgetControl and provide
  some special mouse and keyboard input event handling.
* NxWM::CTaskbar: Correct the calculation of the physical size of the
  display.
