  Title:       DRAGGING ACROSS WINDOWS
  Description: Need some indication if the touch/mouse drags from one window to
               another then is release.  Release event is lost in this case.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  ICON just stays selected and must be touched again.

  Title:       AUTO-RAISE DISABLED
  Description: Auto-raise is currently disabled in nuttx for NX multi-server
               mode.  The
               reason is complex:
               - Most touchscreen controls send touch data a high rates
               - In multi-server mode, touch events get queued in a message
                  queue.
               - The logic that receives the messages performs the auto-raise.
                 But it can do stupid things after the first auto-raise as
                 it opperates on the stale data in the message queue.
               I am thinking that auto-raise ought to be removed from NuttX
               and moved out into a graphics layer (like NxWM) that knows
               more about the appropriate context to do the autoraise.

  Title:       MULTIPLE COPIES OF AN NxCONSOLE
  Description: From the start window, you an create multiple copies of the
               NxConsole.  However, there is a problem in the current
               implementation:  Each NxConsole receives its input from the
               serial console so, for example, it you enter text one character
               will go to one NxConsole instance and the next character goes
               to a different instance.  That is correct behavior within the
               current design, but not very usable.  We need a mechanism to
               assure that the top window is the one that receives all 
               eyboard input.  NX already provides this capability with its
               nx_kbdin interface(), but that is not currently used.  At present,
               NxConsoles get their input from /dev/console which is the serial
               port.  The necessary change is to create an NX input device for
               /dev/console that will get its input from NX.
