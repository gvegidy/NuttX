  Title:       DRAGGING ACROSS WINDOWS
  Description: Need some indication if the touch/mouse drags from one window to
               another then is release.  Release event is lost in this case.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  ICON just stays selected and must be touched again.

  Title:       AUTO-RAISE DISABLED
  Description: Auto-raise is currently disabled in nuttx for NX multi-server
               mode.  The
               reason is complex:
               - Most touchscreen controls send touch data a high rates
               - In multi-server mode, touch events get queued in a message
                  queue.
               - The logic that receives the messages performs the auto-raise.
                 But it can do stupid things after the first auto-raise as
                 it opperates on the stale data in the message queue.
               I am thinking that auto-raise ought to be removed from NuttX
               and moved out into a graphics layer (like NxWM) that knows
               more about the appropriate context to do the autoraise.

  Title:       MULTIPLE COPIES OF AN APPLICATION
  Description: There is a limitation now in that one instance of an application
               an be started at a time.  This limitation is because the
               application container class is created at start-up time; in
               order to have multiple instances of tasks, you would have to
               be able to create multiple container classes from the start
               window.
