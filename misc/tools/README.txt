genromfs-0.5.2.tar.gz

  This is a snapshot of the genromfs tarball taken from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/romfs/.  This snapshot is provided to
  assure that a working version of genromfs is always available for NuttX.

  This tool is also include in the buildroot and can be built automatically
  from the buildroot.

kconfig-frontends-3.3.0-1.tar.gz

  This is a snapshot of the kconfig-frontends tarball taken from
  http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends on April 5, 2012.
  This snapshot is provided so that a working version of the mconf
  utility is always available.

  General build instructions:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

  To suppress the graphical interfaces:

    ./configure --disable-gconf --disable-qconf
    make
    make install

kconfig-frontends-3.3.0-1-libintl.patch

  The above build instructions did not work for me under my Cygwin
  installation.  This patch is a awful hack but will successfully
  build 'mconf' under Cygwin.

    cat kconfig-frontends-3.3.0-1-libintl.patch | patch -p0
    cd kconfig-frontends-3.3.0-1
    ./configure --disable-gconf --disable-qconf
    make
    make install
