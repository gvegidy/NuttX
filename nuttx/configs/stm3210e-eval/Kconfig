config STM3210E_LCD
	bool "Select support for the STM3210E-EVAL LCD"
	default y
	depends on STM32_FSMC

choice
	prompt "STM3210E-EVAL LCD Orientation"
	default LCD_LANDSCAPE
	depends on STM3210E_LCD

config LCD_LANDSCAPE
	bool "320x240 landscape display"
	---help---
		Define for 320x240 display "landscape" support. Default is this 320x240
		"landscape" orientation (this setting is informative only... not used).

config LCD_PORTRAIT
	bool "240x320 portrait display"
	---help---
		Define for 240x320 display "portrait" orientation support.  In this
		orientation, the STM3210E-EVAL's LCD ribbon cable is at the bottom of
		the display. Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.

config LCD_RPORTRAIT
	bool "240x320 reverse portrait display"
	---help---
		Define for 240x320 display "reverse portrait" orientation support.  In
		this orientation, the STM3210E-EVAL's LCD ribbon cable is at the top
		of the display. Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.

config LCD_BACKLIGHT
	bool "LCD backlight support"
	depends on STM3210E_LCD
	default n
	---help---
		Define to support a backlight.

config LCD_PWM
	bool "LCD backlight PWM control"
	default n
	depends on LCD_BACKLIGHT && STM32_TIM1
	---help---
		If STM32_TIM1 is also defined, then an adjustable backlight will be
		provided using timer 1 to generate various pulse widthes.  The
		granularity of the settings is determined by LCD_MAXPOWER.  If LCD_PWM
		(or STM32_TIM1) is not defined, then a simple on/off backlight is
		provided.

config LCD_RDSHIFT
	int "LCD data shift"
	default 5
	depends on STM3210E_LCD
	---help---
		When reading 16-bit gram data, there appears to be a shift in the returned
		data.  This value fixes the offset.  Default 5.

config STM32_AM240320_DISABLE
	bool "Disable AM240320 support"
	default n
	depends on STM3210E_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option

config STM32_SPFD5408B_DISABLE
	bool "Disable SPFD5408B support"
	default n
	depends on STM3210E_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option

config STM32_R61580_DISABLE
	bool "Disable R61580 support"
	default n
	depends on STM3210E_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option
