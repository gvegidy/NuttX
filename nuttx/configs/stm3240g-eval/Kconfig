		"Support control of board LEDs by NuttX to indicate system state"

config ARCH_BUTTONS
	bool "Button support"
	default n

	depends on STM3240G_LCD

config LCD_LANDSCAPE
	bool "320x240 landscape display"
	---help---
		Define for 320x240 display "landscape" support. Default is this 320x240
		"landscape" orientation (this setting is informative only... not used).

config LCD_PORTRAIT
	bool "240x320 portrait display"
	---help---
		Define for 240x320 display "portrait" orientation support.  In this
		orientation, the STM3210E-EVAL's LCD ribbon cable is at the bottom of
		the display. Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.

config LCD_RPORTRAIT
	bool "240x320 reverse portrait display"
	---help---
		Define for 240x320 display "reverse portrait" orientation support.  In
		this orientation, the STM3210E-EVAL's LCD ribbon cable is at the top
		of the display. Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.

config LCD_RDSHIFT
	int "LCD data shift"
	default 5
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		When reading 16-bit gram data, there appears to be a shift in the returned
		data.  This value fixes the offset.  Default 5.

	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9320 (and LCD_ILI9321) support"
	default n
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option.

config CONFIG_STM32_ILI9325_DISABLE
	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9325 support"
	default n
	depends on STM3240G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option
